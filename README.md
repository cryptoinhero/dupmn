# Duplicate MasterNode (dupmn)

A script to easily create and manage multiple masternodes of the same coin in the same VPS, can be easily adapted for almost any other coin by creating a [profile](#profile-creation).

*Note: For any technical question not resolved in this readme, check <a href="https://github.com/risingstar2018/dupmn/wiki/FAQs">the FAQ</a>.*

# <a name ="how-to-install"></a> How to install

On your VPS type:
```
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/risingstar2018/dupmn/master/dupmn_install.sh | sudo -E bash -
```
And that's all, the script is already installed.
Check the [Usage example](#usage-example) to see the guide of the steps to follow.

# <a name ="commands"></a> Commands

- [`dupmn profadd <profile_file> [new_profile_name]`](https://github.com/risingstar2018/dupmn/wiki/Commands#profadd) : Adds a profile with the given name that will be used to create dupes of the masternode.
- [`dupmn profdel <profile_name>`](https://github.com/risingstar2018/dupmn/wiki/Commands#profdel) : Deletes the saved profile with the given name and uninstalls the dupes made with that profile.
- [`dupmn install <profile_name> [params...]`](https://github.com/risingstar2018/dupmn/wiki/Commands#install) : Install a new dupe based on the parameters of the given profile name. Optional `[params]` list:  
`-i IP`, `--ip=IP` : Use a specific IPv4 or IPv6.  
`-r RPC`, `--rpcport=RPC` : Use a specific port for RPC commands (must be valid and not in use).  
`-p KEY`, `--privkey=KEY` : Set a user-defined masternode private key.  
`-b`, `--bootstrap` : Apply a bootstrap during the installation.  
- [`dupmn reinstall <profile_name> <node> [params...]`](https://github.com/risingstar2018/dupmn/wiki/Commands#reinstall) : Reinstalls the specified node number, this is just in case if the instance is giving problems. Optional `[params]` list:  
`-i IP`, `--ip=IP` : Use a specific IPv4 or IPv6.  
`-r RPC`, `--rpcport=RPC` : Use a specific port for RPC commands (must be valid and not in use).  
`-p KEY`, `--privkey=KEY` : Set a user-defined masternode private key.   
`-b`, `--bootstrap` : Apply a bootstrap during the reinstallation.  
- [`dupmn uninstall <profile_name> <node...|all>`](https://github.com/risingstar2018/dupmn/wiki/Commands#uninstall) : Uninstall one or many nodes dupes of the given profile name, you can put `all` instead of a node number to uninstall all the dupes.
- [`dupmn bootstrap <profile_name> <node_1> <node_2>`](https://github.com/risingstar2018/dupmn/wiki/Commands#bootstrap) : Copies the stored chain from the node_1 to the node_2.
- [`dupmn iplist`](https://github.com/risingstar2018/dupmn/wiki/Commands#iplist) : Shows your current IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
- [`dupmn ipadd <ip> <netmask> [interface]`](https://github.com/risingstar2018/dupmn/wiki/Commands#ipadd) : Adds an IPv4 or IPv6 address.
- [`dupmn ipdel <ip> <netmask> [interface]`](https://github.com/risingstar2018/dupmn/wiki/Commands#ipdel) : Deletes an IPv4 or IPv6 address.
- [`dupmn rpcchange <profile_name> <node> [port]`](https://github.com/risingstar2018/dupmn/wiki/Commands#rpcchange) : Changes the rpc port of the given node number, this is only in case that by chance it causes a conflict with another application that uses the same port (if no port is provided, it will automatically find any free port).
- [`dupmn systemctlall <profile_name> <command>`](https://github.com/risingstar2018/dupmn/wiki/Commands#systemctlall) : Applies the systemctl command to all services created with the given profile (will only affect the main node too if the profile haves the COIN_SERVICE parameter).
- [`dupmn list [profile_names...] [params...]`](https://github.com/risingstar2018/dupmn/wiki/Commands#list) : Shows the amount of duplicated instances of every masternode, if a profile name/s are provided, it lists an extended info of the profile/s instances. Optional `[params...]` list:  
`-a`, `--all` : Use all the available params below.  
`-o`, `--online` : Show if the node is active or not.  
`-b`, `--blockcount` : Show the current block number.  
`-s`, `--status` : Show the masternode status message.  
`-i`, `--ip` : Show the ip and port.  
`-r`, `--rpcport` : Show the rpc port.  
`-p`, `--privkey` : Show the masternode private key.  
- [`dupmn swapfile <size_in_mbytes>`](https://github.com/risingstar2018/dupmn/wiki/Commands#swapfile) : Creates/changes or deletes (if value is 0) a swapfile to increase the virtual memory, allowing to fit more masternodes in the same VPS, recommended size is 150 MB for each masternode (example: 3 masternodes => `dupmn swapfile 450`), note that some masternodes might be more 'RAM hungry'.
- [`dupmn checkmem`](https://github.com/risingstar2018/dupmn/wiki/Commands#checkmem) : Shows the RAM usage (in %) of each node group.
- [`dupmn help`](https://github.com/risingstar2018/dupmn/wiki/Commands#help) : Just shows the available commands in the console.
- [`dupmn update`](https://github.com/risingstar2018/dupmn/wiki/Commands#update) : Checks the last version of the script and updates it if necessary.

*Note: `<parameter>` means required, `[parameter]` means optional, `parameter...` means 1 or more parameters, `param1|param2` means either param1 or param2, all `node` are always a number that refers to a dupe (0 is the main node and is allowed in some commands)*  
*Note 2: Check the [Commands Page](https://github.com/risingstar2018/dupmn/wiki/Commands) for extended info and usage examples of each command.*

# <a name ="usage-example"></a> Usage example

Usage example based on the MCPCoin profile:

First install the dupmn script (only needs to be done once):
``` 
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/risingstar2018/dupmn/master/dupmn_install.sh | sudo -E bash -
``` 
Then add the coin profile (if the profile doesn't exists in the [profiles folder](https://github.com/risingstar2018/dupmn/tree/master/profiles), then check [Profile creation](#profile-creation)):
```
wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/risingstar2018/dupmn/master/profiles/MCPCoin.dmn
dupmn profadd MCPCoin.dmn MCPCoin
```
Now the MCPCoin profile is saved and the downloaded file can be removed if you want: `rm -rf MCPCoin.dmn` (you won't need to run the `profadd` command anymore for this coin).


Let's create 3 extra instances (Note that you MUST already have installed the MCPCoin node in the VPS, the script cannot obtain the binaries from nowhere):
```
dupmn install MCPCoin 
dupmn install MCPCoin
dupmn install MCPCoin
```
Every instance has it own private key, it will be shown after installing the new instance, also can be seen with `dupmn list MCPCoin`.

Now you can manage every instance like this:
```
MCPCoin-cli-1 getmasternodestatus
MCPCoin-cli-2 getblockcount
MCPCoin-cli-3 getinfo
MCPCoin-cli-all getmasternodestatus
```
There's also a `MCPCoin-cli-0`, but is just a reference to the 'main node', not a created one with dupmn.

When you get tired of one masternode, per example the 3rd instance, then just uninstall it with:
```
dupmn uninstall MCPCoin 3
```
Or you can even uninstall them all (except the 'main node') with:
```
dupmn uninstall MCPCoin all
```
The new masternode instances will use the same IP and port, so the `masternode.conf` will look like this:
```
MN01 123.45.67.89:49451 4xbupX4SFDqettRaKSkLB5hoCVJbTBmK5UfDcja5o5y2C3E3mWZ a4d79e50933ce430a3b2874738a156f3ecb866e598d7c9ecf3382902e2d29afd 0
MN02 123.45.67.89:49451 4y9xiAx7npcE88gCjqbQfYJHkvgY4V2of9T87gd2qyACohH8SpQ 26072b1000545db553c425c776cea9d29ef341512dd88b7522419db7dd952ebc 0
MN03 123.45.67.89:49451 4xP6ZwspdJ6qRwzZUZW4VSLXxR3z15zYnwA6wc1CUWk9pCdjrA2 349acfcf2ea88ab0f9f165ebfd4b98273e260b813b757242e1f371d7075d3f94 1
MN04 123.45.67.89:49451 4yUJe3fzQ8t11ukVULUrKfHUswujAwRWi33tTXp41rsEc9PENM8 6dbff523ae79c29c48bcd77231f15c0b8354daa2ea32cb46ed0dd0fe31ec7e82 0
```
Using `dupmn install MCPCoin` will show you the masternode private key for that instance, the transaction must be obviosuly different for each masternode, you can't use the same transaction to run 2 masternodes, even if they're in the same VPS.

*Note: `dupmn install MCPCoin` will show you also a different rpc port, this is NOT the port that you have to add in the `masternode.conf` file, every masternode will use the same port (49451 in case of MCPCoin).*  

# <a name ="profile-creation"></a> Profile creation

You can easily create your own profile to fit with any other coin:
```
COIN_NAME="OtherCoin"             # Name of the coin
COIN_PATH="/usr/local/bin/"       # NOT required parameter, location of the daemon and cli (only required if they're not in /usr/local/bin/ or /usr/bin/)
COIN_DAEMON="OtherCoind"          # Name of the daemon
COIN_CLI="OtherCoin-cli"          # Name of the cli
COIN_FOLDER="/root/.OtherCoin"    # Folder where the conf file and blockchain are stored
COIN_CONFIG="OtherCoin.conf"      # Name of the conf file
RPC_PORT=45454                    # NOT required parameter, it's just to force to start looking from a specific rpc port for those coins that doesn't have a rpcport parameter in the .conf file or that the main node rpc port is not between 1024 and 49451 (otherwise it will start looking at 1024).
COIN_SERVICE="OtherCoin.service"  # NOT required parameter, if you have a service for the main node, add this parameter for the systemctlall and bootstrap commands.
FORCE_LISTEN=1                    # USE ONLY IF THE MASTERNODE FORCES YOU TO HAVE listen=1 ON THE .CONF FILE, some mns forces you to use a different IP for each MN, but a few of them also forces you to listen a binded socket, this parameter will change how the dupes are installed to work with them (NOTE: they usually will force you to use a IPv4).
```
As with the <b>Usage example</b>, you just need to type these commands to create a new duplicated masternode:
```
dupmn profadd othercoin.dmn othercoin
dupmn install othercoin
```

*Note: The .dmn extension is completely optional, it is done in this way to differentiate the profile file from others.*

# <a name ="considerations"></a> Considerations

A VPS doesn't have unlimited resources, creating too many instances may cause Out-Of-Memory error since MNs are a bit "RAM hungry" (can be partially fixed with [`dupmn swapfile`](https://github.com/neo3587/dupmn/wiki/Commands#swapfile) command), there's also a limited hard-disk space and the blockchain increases in size everyday (so be sure to have a lot of free hard disk space, can be checked with `df -h`), and VPS providers usually puts a limit on monthly network bandwith (so running too many instances may get you to that limit).
